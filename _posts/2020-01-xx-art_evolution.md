title: The Evolution of the Android Runtime (ART)
---
The history of the Android Runtime started with Dalvik in November, 2007. This is when the Android beta was publicly released. BTW, Dalvik is a village in Iceland. At that time devices powered by a battery had slow CPUs, little RAM and an OS without swap space.
