Hello!

I am Evgeny Astigeevich.
I am a compiler engineer. Since 2014 I've been working on a LLVM-based compiler (Arm compiler): fixing defects, implementing optimizations, leading teams.
At the moment I am on a team responsible for optimizing the Android Runtime (ART) JIT and AOT compilers for ARM architectures.
