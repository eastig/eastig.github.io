title: Introduction to the Android Runtime (ART)
---
I’ve been working with the Android Runtime for more than a year. The biggest difficulty for people joining our team is missing documentation. I started writing posts about the Android Runtime to solve the problem.

Let’s start with the introduction to the Android Runtime.

If we look at the Android Platform Architecture

we can notice that above the Hardware Abstraction Layer there are two components: the Native Libraries and the Android Runtime. It is clear what the Native Libraries are. They are libraries written in C/C++ used by system components or which provide API, e.g. the C/C++ libraries and OpenGL ES. To access these libraries, we need the Android NDK.

Android apps written in Java/Kotlin are first compiled into Java bytecode and then compiled into Dex bytecode. The Android Runtime (ART) is the managed runtime to execute Dex bytecode. It is a sophisticated runtime. If we compare it with popular Java runtimes, we can find ART has more advanced features than JVMs, for example App Images. Not only user app use the Android Runtime, the Android Framework also relies on it. Some parts of the Android OS written in Java are involved in the device booting process. So device boot time depends on how fast the Android Runtime is.

As other managed runtimes the Android Runtime has the following components:
- Runtime:
-- An interpreter.
-- Core libraries.
-- A memory management system with automatic garbage collection.
- Just-In-Time compiler.

On a smartphone users expect apps start quickly, run smoothly, and UI don’t lag. This made ART heavily exploit the Ahead-Of-Time compiler. Another heavily used feature is the Profile Guided Optimization. The Android runtime uses PGO to improve start-up time, to reduce disk space usage.

All these features did not appear at the same time. They are a result of changes in device configurations and user experience. The next post will be about evolution of ART.
